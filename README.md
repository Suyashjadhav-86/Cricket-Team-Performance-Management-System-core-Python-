Best score

⭐ Performance classification:

Excellent

Good

Average

Poor

💾 Save player data to a text file

📂 Load saved data on startup

⚠️ Input validation & exception handling

✔ Introduction to Python

Variables, input/output, comments

✔ Control Flow

if–elif–else for performance grading

✔ Loops

for loops to enter multiple scores

while loop for menu system

✔ Data Structures

Lists for storing runs

Dictionaries/Objects to maintain records

✔ Functions

Modular code design (add_score, average, best_score)
